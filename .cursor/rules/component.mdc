- Keep the component small meaning each sligtly large piece of UI has its own file
- the naming convention should be Domain oriented
- the File name for Component Always start with capital leter and further on follows Camel cases
example: SimpleFilter.tsx ,  CriteriaFilter.tsx, ProfilePage.tsx, ErrorDialogForFailedResponses.tsx etc

- Component props type is always name "Props"
example:  
----
type Props = {
    title: string
    onClick: () => void
}

const CoolButton : FC<Props> = ({ title, onClick }) => {
    
}
-----

- Always use FC type from react to represent type of component.

- Always use const to create component functions
example: 
const CoolButton : FC<Props> = ({ title, onClick }) => { }


- every component is exported using default export from its file:
example:

const CoolButton : FC<Props> = ({ title, onClick }) => { }

export default CoolButton
