When creating a React component I see components in two ways and i want you to do same.
1. Component represent a functionality or atleast encapsulate a functionality/feature.
for example. A component named Profile.tsx represent a functionality that is a Profile meaning all sub components of a Profile such as SideBar main contents etc will be encapsulated by Profile.
So in such cases whenever such functionality or feature is encountered i want to create a directory of the component and inside I keep the same Component and every sub component or util or the types used comes under same Directory with a index.ts exporting the main component representing the functionality
Like:
Profile/
        Content/
            Account.tsx
            Setting.tsx
            ProfileInfo.tsx
            Content.tsx
            index.ts
        SideBar.tsx
        Profile.tsx
        index.ts

2. The component Represents a small portion of a larger functionality.
For example a SideBar.tsx represent a piece of content of a Profile functionality.
So such components are to be made as is
example: 
Profile/
        SideBar.tsx
        Profile.tsx
        index.ts
